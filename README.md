Just a simple ball-smashing game written in Python.

No license, no copyrights. Just pull it and make your own game.

Unfortunately, nobody made a guide about how to play. Can you?

How to play:
1. Click on a ball to select it.
2. Click on an empty tile, to move the ball to that tile.
3. Vertical and horizontal rows of 5 or more same coloured balls get destroyed.
4. New balls are spawned every move, so when all tiles are occupied, you lose.
