Just a simple ball-smashing game written in Python.

No license, no copyrights. Just pull it and make your own game.

Unfortunately, nobody made a guide about how to play. Can you?

---

How do you play? - 
    When the game starts there is a playing grid with randomly generated balls.
    The balls can be any of the three colors - green, red or blue.
    Player can choose any ball to move. 
    By clicking the ball and then clicking an empty cell you can move the chosen ball. 
    After moving the ball new balls appear on the playing grid.
    To remove balls you have to make rows/collums of the same color balls.
    Games target is to move the balls to create rows/collums to not fill the playing grid.
